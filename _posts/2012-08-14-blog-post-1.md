I think this course [cs294-ai-sys-sp22](https://ucbrise.github.io/cs294-ai-sys-sp22/) is a very good introductory course on ML systems. I will read the papers in it and write detailed reviews and comments.

[SysML: The New Frontier of Machine Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03257)
------------------------------------------------------

- **Designing software systems to support the full machine learning lifecycle**: 
  - Enabling quick "programming" of ML models through emerging interfaces.
  - Supporting development, monitoring, debugging etc. of production ML applications.
  - Defining ML models and systems in higher-level ways.

- **Designing hardware systems optimized for machine learning**:
  - Developing specialized hardware for ML workloads.
  - Taking advantage of properties like stochasticity for new trade-offs.
  - Distributed systems design for ML.  

- **Designing ML systems for metrics beyond accuracy**: 
  - Power efficiency, accessibility, cost, latency, privacy, security, fairness, and interpretability.
  - Techniques like federated learning for privacy/security.
  - Making ML more accessible to non-experts.
  - Optimizations for on-device deployment.

[Principles of Computer System Design](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123749574000104#st0015)
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Introduction**: 
  - Defines the concept of "system".
  - Provides a technical definition.

2. **Viewpoint Analysis**: 
  - Purpose, granularity of components.
  - System boundary and interfaces of interest.

3. **Five Signs of Complexity**:
  - Large number of components and interconnections.
  - Many irregularities.
  - Long description.
  - Team of designers needed.

4. **Sources of Complexity**:
  - Cascading and interacting requirements.
  - Maintaining high utilization.

5. **Coping Techniques**:
  - Modularity, abstraction, layering, hierarchy.

6. **Computer Systems Distinctions**:
  - No physical limits on composition.
  - Unprecedented rate of technology change.

7. **Additional Techniques**:
  - Iteration and "keep it simple" principle.

8. **Themes of the Book**:
  - Modularity.
  - Principle-based design.
  - Building robust and resilient systems.
