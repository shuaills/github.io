I think this course is a very good introductory course [cs294-ai-sys-sp22](https://ucbrise.github.io/cs294-ai-sys-sp22/) on ML systems. I will read the papers in it and write detailed reviews and comments.

[SysML: The New Frontier of Machine Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03257)
------
1.Designing software systems to support the full machine learning lifecycle - This includes enabling quick "programming" of ML models through emerging interfaces, supporting development, monitoring, debugging etc. of production ML applications, and defining ML models and systems in higher-level ways.
2.Designing hardware systems optimized for machine learning - This includes developing specialized hardware for ML workloads, taking advantage of properties like stochasticity for new trade-offs, and distributed systems design for ML.
3.Designing ML systems for metrics beyond accuracy - Such as power efficiency, accessibility, cost, latency, privacy, security, fairness and interpretability. This involves techniques like federated learning to enable privacy/security, making ML more accessible to non-experts, optimizations for on-device deployment etc.
