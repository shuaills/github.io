# How to Read a Paper - Summary

## Three-Pass Approach

- **First pass** (5-10 mins):
    - Read title, abstract, intro, headings, conclusions
    - Get bird's-eye view and assess category, context, correctness, contributions, clarity

- **Second pass** (up to 1 hour):
    - Read in detail, ignore proofs
    - Jot down key points and questions
    - Grasp main thrust and evidence

- **Third pass** (1-5 hours): 
    - Virtually recreate the work
    - Identify assumptions, gaps, innovations
    - Challenge assumptions and evaluate techniques

## Literature Surveys

- Find 3-5 recent papers with academic search, skim their related work 

- Identify shared citations and repeated author names. Download their key papers.

- Look at where top researchers publish to identify top conferences in that field

- Quickly scan recent proceedings of top conferences to find high-quality related work

- Iteratively read key papers found from backwards snowball sampling process

## Benefits

- Allows estimating time needed to review papers
- Adjust depth as needed
- Provides efficient systematic way to thoroughly read and understand key points
- Helpful for reviewing, literature surveys, keeping up with research
